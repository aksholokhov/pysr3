abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models are a class of models widely used for analyzing different types of data: longitudinal, clustered and panel data. Many fields, in which a statistical methodology is required, involve the employment of linear mixed models, such as biology, chemistry, medicine, finance and so forth. One of the most important processes, in a statistical analysis, is given by model selection. Hence, since there are a large number of linear mixed model selection procedures available in the literature, a pressing issue is how to identify the best approach to adopt in a specific case. We outline mainly all approaches focusing on the part of the model subject to selection (fixed and/or random), the dimensionality of models and the structure of variance and covariance matrices, and also, wherever possible, the existence of an implemented application of the methodologies set out.},

@article{Zheng2020,
abstract = {We develop and analyze a new 'relax-and-split' (RS) approach for inverse problems modeled using nonsmooth nonconvex optimization formulations. RS uses a relaxation technique together with partial minimization, and brings classic techniques including direct factorization, matrix decompositions, and fast iterative methods to bear on nonsmooth nonconvex problems. We also extend the approach to robustify any such inverse problem through trimming, a mechanism that robustifies inverse problems to measurement outliers. We then show practical performance of RS and trimmed RS (TRS) on a diverse set of problems, including: (1) phase retrieval, (2) semi-supervised classification, (3) stochastic shortest path problems, and (4) nonconvex clustering. RS/TRS are easy to implement, competitive with existing methods, and show promising results on difficult inverse problems with nonsmooth and nonconvex features.},
